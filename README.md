# Population-Weighted Coverage Analysis: Maternal & Child Health

This repository contains the code and structure for calculating population-weighted coverage of Antenatal Care (ANC4) and Skilled Birth Attendance (SBA) for countries categorized by their under-five mortality (U5MR) target status (on-track vs. off-track). The analysis uses data from the UNICEF Global Data Repository and UN World Population Prospects.
---
The project is designed to demonstrate a reproducible, end-to-end data analysis workflow suitable for collaborative environments.

## 📝 Purpose of Each Folder and File

* `.gitignore`: Tells Git which files or directories to ignore (e.g., `user_profile.R`, temporary files, large data files that are managed separately). This is crucial for keeping sensitive information out of the repository and preventing unnecessary version control of temporary files.
* `README.md`: Provides a comprehensive overview of the project, its goals, data sources, methodology, and instructions for anyone wanting to understand or reproduce the analysis.
* `user_profile.R.template`: A template file that defines machine-specific parameters (like file paths, input filenames, output settings). This file is *not* committed to the Git repository. Each user copies this template to `user_profile.R` and customizes it for their local environment.
* `run_project.R`: The master script that orchestrates the entire analysis pipeline. It sources `user_profile.R` to load local settings, then calls functions from the `02_scripts/` folder in sequence to perform data preparation, analysis, and report generation.

* `01_rawdata/`: This folder is intended for raw, immutable data. Data files should ideally be placed here and not modified directly.
    * `MCindicatorsTracking.xlsx`: This consolidated Excel workbook contains the UNICEF health indicators (ANC4 and SBA) on the `"fusion_GLOBAL_DATAFLOW_UNICEF_1"` sheet, and the Under-five mortality classification on the `"Sheet1"` sheet.
    * `Projections.csv`: This CSV file contains the UN World Population Prospects 2022 data, used for population figures.

* `02_scripts/`: Contains modular R scripts, each encapsulating specific steps of the workflow as functions. This promotes code reusability, readability, and easier debugging.
    * `data_preparation.R`: Handles the loading of various data sources, cleaning country identifiers, merging datasets, and filtering for the most recent estimates within the specified time range.
    * `analysis.R`: Contains the logic for calculating the population-weighted averages for ANC4 and SBA.
    * `visualization.R`: Contains the function to generate the comparative plot for the report.

* `03_output/`: This folder stores all outputs generated by the `run_project.R` script, ensuring that results are organized and separate from code and raw data.
    * `figures/`: A subfolder specifically for saving generated plots.
    * *(Final Report)*: The generated PDF, HTML, or DOCX report will be saved directly in `03_output/`.

## ⚙️ Instructions on How to Reproduce Your Analysis

Follow these steps to set up the project and reproduce the analysis on your local machine:

### 1. Initial Setup (Git & RStudio)

a.  **Clone the Repository:**
    * Open your Git Bash terminal (Windows) or Terminal (macOS/Linux).
    * Navigate to your preferred local directory for Git projects (e.g., `C:/Users/YourUsername/Documents/GitProjects/` or `~/Documents/GitProjects/`). **Ensure this directory is NOT synced by cloud services like OneDrive, Google Drive, or Dropbox for active Git repositories.**
    * Clone this repository:
        ```bash
        git clone [https://github.com/AungLwin25/MaternalCare.git](https://github.com/AungLwin25/MaternalCare.git) # Replace with your actual repo URL
        ```
    * Navigate into the cloned directory:
        ```bash
        cd MaternalCare
        ```

b.  **Open as an RStudio Project:**
    * Open RStudio.
    * Go to `File > New Project...`
    * Select `Existing Directory`.
    * Browse to the `MaternalCare` folder you just cloned (e.g., `C:/Users/YourUsername/Documents/GitProjects/MaternalCare`).
    * Click `Create Project`.

### 2. Install Required R Packages

Ensure you have all necessary R packages installed. You can run this in your RStudio Console:

r``` install.packages(c("readxl", "dplyr", "Hmisc", "ggplot2", "rmarkdown", "knitr", "readr"))

### 3. Obtain and Place Raw Data
You need to manually download the following files and place them into the 01_rawdata/ folder within your cloned MaternalCare project directory:

* Consolidated Data Workbook:
* File: MCindicatorsTracking.xlsx
* Content: Contains UNICEF health indicators (ANC4 and SBA) on the "fusion_GLOBAL_DATAFLOW_UNICEF_1" sheet, and Under-five mortality classification on the "Sheet1" sheet.
* Source: This integrated file should be provided as part of the collaborative exercise.
---
* Population Data (CSV): <br>
* File: Projections.csv
* Source: UN World Population Prospects, 2022. This is the CSV counterpart to the Excel sheet.

### 4. Configure user_profile.R
This is a critical step for reproducibility across different machines.

a.  Copy the Template:
* In your RStudio Files pane, navigate to the main project directory.
* Find user_profile.R.template.
* Copy this file and rename the copy to user_profile.R (remove the .template extension).

b.  Edit user_profile.R:
* Open the newly created user_profile.R file.
* Carefully read the comments within the file.
* Update all paths and filenames to accurately reflect their location and names on your specific computer. Pay close attention to base_project_dir, main_excel_workbook_filename, and wpp_csv_filename.
* Choose your desired report_output_format ("html_document", "pdf_document", or "word_document").
* Save the user_profile.R file.

*Remember: `user_profile.R` is in your `.gitignore` and will NOT be pushed to GitHub, keeping your local settings private.*

### 5. Run the Project Workflow
Once all data is in place and user_profile.R is configured, you can run the entire analysis.

* Open the run_project.R script in RStudio.
* Click the Source button (or press Ctrl+Shift+S / Cmd+Shift+S). <br>

This script will:
* Load your local settings from user_profile.R.
* Load and prepare all raw data.
* Perform the population-weighted coverage calculations.
* Generate the visualization.
* Create the final report (PDF/HTML/DOCX) in the 03_output/ folder.

### 6. Review Outputs
Check the 03_output/ folder for your generated report and any saved figures.

## 🥰 Collaborative Workflow & Reproducibility
This project structure supports collaboration and reproducibility by:
---
* Version Control: All code (.R, .gitignore, README.md, user_profile.R.template) is version-controlled with Git and hosted on GitHub, allowing tracking of changes, collaboration via branches and pull requests, and easy access to historical versions.
* Clear Folder Organization: Separating raw data, scripts, and outputs ensures clarity and prevents accidental modification of raw data.
* user_profile.R for Portability: By centralizing machine-specific paths and settings, the core analysis scripts remain universal. New collaborators only need to adjust one local file.
* run_project.R for End-to-End Execution: A single script allows anyone to run the entire analysis pipeline from start to finish, ensuring consistency and ease of reproduction.
* Embedded R Markdown for Dynamic Reporting: The report content is embedded within run_project.R, ensuring the report is dynamically generated from the latest code and data without requiring users to manage a separate R Markdown file, enhancing transparency and reproducibility of findings.
